Our client provide Logistic services in different modes like Domestic services via trucks, International service via Ocean service etc.. It gives the ability for customers to enquire and shipping the products including cars, household goods, food products etc... A customer needs to register and then log in using the registered credentials, then the customer needs to search the products & will be viewing the displayed products. If they have any queries about the products, those will be discussed with the consultants by email. If the customers wish to buy the products, they can place the order and after completing the payment process, an email will be sent to the customer whether the payment is successful or not. Once the order is placed they deliver within the timeline.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nUsed aura components in creating a homepage, product details page for viewing the products and payment page for this portal.\nPicklists have been used for selecting the product type and dependent picklists for selecting the relevant products. SOQL have written to fetch products from the server.\n\nCreated different users and assigned to different profiles according to their permissions. Queues are used to add multiple consultants for answering the queries asked by the customers.\nSharing rules are implemented to share the records among admins based on their roles and public groups. Different page layouts are customized for different profiles.\nValidation rules are used for registering the user. Developed apex controllers for various functional needs in this application. Written test classes to check correctness of controller class functionality. Apex triggers are implemented to send mail based on the payment status.\nEmail templates are customized to communicate between customers & consultants and for sending payment confirmation.\nAutomation tools are used such as workflow rules to update the payment status. Schedulable classes are implemented to ensure the payment process is effective.\nMercantile Agency\nOur client is one of the leading Mercantile companies in design, manufacture, supply, and installation of cost-effective material and components for industries, warehouses, solar structures, and many others. They will be manufacturing the metallic products and those will be sent for approval to Quality Analyst, if the product gets approved it will move to the final phase. If the product gets rejected, it will again send for approval to senior Quality Analyst, they will decide whether the product will get repaired or it will move to the melting phase to start manufacturing the new product. The approved products will be sent through delivery service, the products can be tracked till the product gets delivered to the customer. Organisation’s data can be visualized using reports and dashboards.\nResponsibilities:\nAura components have been used in designing home pages & created custom objects and fields to store products.\nValidation rules are used for validating the product name & formula field to calculate the price.\nCreated users & assigned different profiles with different permissions.\nAutomation tools have been used such as approval process to approve & reject manufacturing products and process builder to create records based on the status field.\nApex classes are used to implement custom functionality and test class to ensure code coverage.\n\nCreated reports and dashboards to visualize the data in the organization.\nChangesets are used to deploy components from Development environment to Sandbox and from Sandbox to Production.\n\n","entities":[{"id":232,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":72,"end_offset":82},{"id":233,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":414,"end_offset":418},{"id":234,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":423,"end_offset":427},{"id":235,"label":"ROLE","start_offset":1123,"end_offset":1138},{"id":236,"label":"ORG","start_offset":1142,"end_offset":1156},{"id":237,"label":"DATES","start_offset":1162,"end_offset":1187},{"id":238,"label":"ROLE","start_offset":1208,"end_offset":1225},{"id":239,"label":"ORG","start_offset":1229,"end_offset":1234},{"id":240,"label":"DATES","start_offset":1297,"end_offset":1324},{"id":241,"label":"ROLE","start_offset":1346,"end_offset":1359},{"id":242,"label":"ORG","start_offset":1363,"end_offset":1378},{"id":243,"label":"DATES","start_offset":1413,"end_offset":1448},{"id":244,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1479,"end_offset":1483},{"id":245,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1510,"end_offset":1526},{"id":246,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1528,"end_offset":1548},{"id":247,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1550,"end_offset":1565},{"id":248,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1567,"end_offset":1572},{"id":249,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1574,"end_offset":1596},{"id":250,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1598,"end_offset":1602},{"id":251,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1604,"end_offset":1608},{"id":252,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1610,"end_offset":1634},{"id":253,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1639,"end_offset":1652},{"id":254,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1672,"end_offset":1676},{"id":255,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1678,"end_offset":1681},{"id":256,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1686,"end_offset":1696},{"id":257,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1705,"end_offset":1724},{"id":258,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1726,"end_offset":1735},{"id":259,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1737,"end_offset":1746},{"id":260,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1767,"end_offset":1770},{"id":261,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":1775,"end_offset":1784},{"id":262,"label":"CERTIFICATION","start_offset":1801,"end_offset":1844},{"id":263,"label":"SKILL","start_offset":2968,"end_offset":2972}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]},
